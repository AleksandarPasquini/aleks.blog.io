    "text": "Hello Internet! Today I am going to follow up my first experiment. My last experiment studied the summarisation abilities of GTP-4 vs Humans but the evaluation what does done by me. This is obviously biased so instead I am now going to use more “objective” metrics So what metrics can I use? I am just going to focus on the two most common ones: BLEU and ROUGE.\nBLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) metric is a method for mainly evaluating the quality of text which has been machine-translated from one natural language to another. However, this can be extended to summaries. The core idea is to measure how many N-grams (a sequence of N words) in the machine translation match those in the reference translations. This idea of comparing a candidate text to one or more reference texts is applicable to summarisation as well. The BLEU forumla is as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{BLEU} = \\text{BP} * \\exp(\\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \\log (p_n))\n\\]\nWhere:\n\\[\n\\text{BP} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } c &gt; r \\\\\n\\exp(1 - \\frac{r}{c}) & \\text{if } c \\leq r\n\\end{cases}\n\\] \\[\n\\text{p}_n = \\frac{\\text{Number of matching n-grams in machine translation}}{\\text{Total number of n-grams in machine translation}}\n\\] \\[\nc = \\text{Length of the machine-translated text}\n\\] \\[\nr = \\text{Reference corpus length}\n\\] \\[\nw_n = \\text{The weight associated with the nth gram precision}\n\\]\nROUGE, which stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, is a set of metrics used for evaluating automatic summarization of texts as well as machine translation. ROUGE includes series different metrics but today we will just focus on ROUGE-N. ROUGE-N measures the overlap of N-grams between the computer-generated summary and the reference summaries. For example, ROUGE-1 refers to the overlap of individual words, ROUGE-2 refers to the overlap of two-word phrases, and so on. The forumla for ROUGE-1 is shown below:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of matched n-grams from the generated summary}}{\\text{Total n-grams in the reference summary}}\n\\] \\[\n\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of matched n-grams from the generated summary}}{\\text{Total n-grams in the generated summary}}\n\\] \\[\n\\text{F1} = \\frac{2*\\text{Precision}*\\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision}*\\text{Recall}}\n\\]\nWhile both BLEU and ROUGE count matching n-grams, BLEU is more precision-oriented, assessing how much of the generated text is correct, while ROUGE is recall-oriented, evaluating how much of the reference text is covered by the generated text.\nI will now test and see how well my and Scholar AI’s summary actually summarise. To do this I will use the conclusion from the The rise of traffic classification in IoT networks: A survey as the reference summary.\nfrom rouge import Rouge\nfrom nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu\n\nreference = \"This paper surveyed recent works in the field of traffic classification in the IoT domain.

Therefore the BLEU score evaluates to 0, independently of how many N-gram overlaps of lower order it contains. Consider using lower n-gram order or use SmoothingFunction()\n\n\nUserWarning: The hypothesis contains 0 counts of 3-gram overlaps. Therefore the BLEU score evaluates to 0, independently of how many N-gram overlaps of lower order it contains.

This causes the BLEU score to go to 0. Additionally, the rouge-1 is slight higher but the scores are still close to zero. This highlights the main flaw with BLEU and ROUGE. Thier reliance on overlapping n-grams means they focus on surface-level lexical similarities rather than the deeper conceptual understanding or coherence of the text. This approach can be problematic for summaries, where the essence is to distill complex information into concise, comprehensible forms while retaining the core meaning and context. They overlook aspects such as whether the summary captures the nuances of the original text, maintains logical coherence, or presents the information in an easily digestible manner. However, it would be very hard to qualify those aspects. A job for another PhD!"

    "text": "Hello Internet! Today I want to test the summarisation powers of GTP-4, specifically ScholarAI. There has been a lot of marketing around ScholarAI’s ability to summarise research papers but I do not know if the generated summaries convey the concepts well enough. So today I want to test their responses and check their quality.\nIn order to do this test, we need a ground truth and for that I will be using my summaries that I wrote at the beginning of my PhD. Now admittedly, these summaries many not be the best but I still think it will serve as a good baseline. Also, I have written many summaries and I do not have time to go through them all. So I will just select one from the beginning of my background readings.\nSo we have the ground truth sorted, I now need some generated text to compare them to. But what prompt will I use to generate text from GPT-4? I do not want to give it too many instructions because this is a test of its innate abilities. I will give it one limitation of a maximum of 300 words as that was my limit. Other than that, I will keep it simple so: Give me a 300 word summary for the paper titled &lt;paper name&gt;\nNow lets see the results. We will begin with a very important paper for me: The rise of traffic classification in IoT networks: A survey. The following is my summary:\n\nTahaei et al (2020) surveyed different traffic classifications for IoT devices. Traditionally, internet service providers used traffic classification as a way to better manage network performance. Recent research indicates the importance of classifying IoT traffic patterns for security purposes. IoT devices generally produce stable and predictable traffic patterns thus it is easy to detect when they have been compromised. A traffic classification technique falls into one of four categories, specifically: Port-Based, Payload-Based, Statistical-Based and Behavioural-Based. Port-Based classification involves mapping an application to a port using a packet header. Thus, if a device is sending traffic to the same ports as another device it implies that it is the same kind of device. This technique is fast and can work in real time. However, modern IoT devices could use unregistered port numbers or dynamically/maliciously use a different port, which will lower the accuracy of these classifiers. Payload-Based classification is used to overcome those challenges by looking at the entire packet to match it to a device. Intrusion detection systems use this technique to detect malware with high accuracy. This technique is limited in (i) dealing with encrypted or encapsulated packets and (ii) has a higher computing cost for high volume traffic compared to Port-Based. Statistic-Based techniques also try to solve these issues. Attributes from the flow-level are used to fingerprint traffic sources and classify them. These attributes can be generated without into the packets, thus, allowing for the classification of devices with encrypted traffic. However, performance is highly dependent on the attributes that are selected and the more attributes there are, the slower the classifier will run. Behavioural-Based looks at all traffic received by the host and requires access to the end-point. Therefore, scalability is an issue and future work needs to find a balance between prediction accuracy and speed.\n\nAnd this is ScholarAI’s:\n\nThe paper titled “The rise of traffic classification in IoT networks: A survey” by Hamid Tahaei, Firdaus Afifi, A. Asemi, Faiz Zaki, and N. B. Anuar, published on March 15, 2020, provides an insightful survey into the burgeoning field of traffic classification within Internet of Things (IoT) networks (Tahaei et al., 2020). This paper is pivotal in understanding the complexities and nuances of IoT networks, especially in comparison to non-IoT devices.\n\n\nThe crux of the paper revolves around the distinctive traffic characteristics that are inherent to IoT devices. These characteristics set IoT networks apart from traditional network systems. The authors delve into the specifics of how IoT devices generate and manage data traffic, which is crucial for understanding the operational intricacies of these networks. The survey also highlights the diverse range of applications and services that IoT networks support, underlining their growing importance in the modern digital landscape.\n\n\nFurthermore, the paper extensively covers the role and utility of traffic classification in IoT networks. Traffic classification is a critical process for managing and optimizing network performance, security, and data flow within IoT systems. By categorizing and analyzing the data traffic generated by IoT devices, network administrators and engineers can better understand and improve the efficiency, reliability, and security of these networks.\n\n\nIn summary, “The rise of traffic classification in IoT networks: A survey” serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners in the field, offering a detailed overview of the current state and challenges of traffic classification in IoT networks. It emphasizes the unique aspects of IoT traffic and the pivotal role of traffic classification in harnessing the full potential of IoT technology.\n\nTwo things stand out to me. The first is that the final paragraph that ScholarAI generated is useless. It is a summary of a summary and adds no value. 63 words were used to summarise the other 210 words. Those words should have been used instead to explore some of the proposed concepts deeper. This brings us to the second point. The concepts in the ScholarAI’s reponse seem very shallow. It is too high level to gain an actual understanding of what the authors’ wrote. In fact, the second paragraph could be used to describe multiple different papers on IoT networks.\nI would say that my summary is better at conveying the concepts but perhaps this is due to the word limit. So let us do this again without that constraint:\n\nThe paper titled “The rise of traffic classification in IoT networks: A survey” by Hamid Tahaei et al., published on March 15, 2020, delves into the evolving field of traffic classification methods within Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This research highlights the distinct traffic characteristics that differentiate IoT devices from Non-IoT devices. It also presents a comprehensive taxonomy of the existing network traffic classification methods specifically tailored for the IoT context. Furthermore, the paper identifies and discusses open research issues and challenges in this domain, shedding light on the complexities and nuances of traffic classification in IoT networks.\n\nInteresting, it wrote less! I would argue this second summary is better than the first as even tho it is still at a too high level for me, it does a better job summarising with less words.\nSo in summary wink, I would say that GTPs actually do not provide an in-depth summary but do an ok high level overview of the papers. Maybe this will change in the future but for now human summaries are better."
